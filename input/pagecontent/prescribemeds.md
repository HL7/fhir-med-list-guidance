## Prescribed Medications

### Assumptions
May include current and/or previously prescribed medicines. Does not indicate prescriptions have been filled, only that a prescription has been provided. 

Should this include repeat prescriptions - instance orders?

### Rationale
Provide a list of prescribed medications provided to a patient either current prescriptions or a list of historical prescriptions written.

* New prescriber for patient receiving a history of previously prescribed medications (current and/or ceased)
* List provider to specialist on referral
* Summary of prescribed medicines during hospital admission for community GP
* List of prescribed medicines (current and/or ceased) from current prescriber to facility
* List of prescribed medicines collected centrally by jurisdictions for the purpose of monitoring or program provision (Drugs of dependence monitoring, oral dosing programs etc)
* Centralised/aggregated ePrescribing systems providing current list of 'active' prescriptions available for dispensing/supply
* Electronic health records for both practitioners and patients
* Patient or care giver view of currently prescribed medications eg. patient app, health application

### Settings
Any setting in which a prescription may be provided to a patient.

* Community - clinical information systems both general practice and specialist
* Hospital - EHR
* Residential and Aged Care - electronic chart and administration systems
* Facility - jails and other facilities
* Jurisdictional systems - prescription monitoring systems, dose point providers
* Systems supporting ePrescribing, centralised electronic health records
* Patients, care givers

### Description
* List of current medications prescribed to a patient by an authorised prescriber.
* List of all medications (current and/or ceased) prescribed to a patient by an authorised presriber.
* List of repeat authorisations for prescribed medications???
